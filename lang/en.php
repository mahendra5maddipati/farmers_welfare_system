define('_CONTENT_MODAL', 'Since the 1960s, the world food system has responded to a doubling of the world population, providing more food per capita at progressively lower prices. Global nutrition has consistently improved. This performance was possible through a combination of high-yielding seeds, irrigation, plant nutrition and pest control. In the process, large quantities of water were appropriated for agriculture. As population keeps increasing, albeit at a slower rate, more food and livestock feed need to be produced in the future and more water applied to this purpose. Water withdrawals for irrigation in developing countries are expected to increase by an aggregated 14 percent until 2030, while irrigation water use efficiency is expected to improve by an average 4 percent. Water-scarcity stress is foreseen to grow locally and in some cases regionally and a number of countries will have to rely more on trade for their food security.<br/><br/>

While food production is satisfying market demand at historically low prices, an estimated 777 million people in developing countries do not have access to sufficient and adequate food because they do not have the resources to buy it or, in the case of subsistence farmers, to produce it. In spite of the overall improvement in the nutritional situation, the absolute number of undernourished people is reducing at a much slower rate than had been anticipated. The 1996 World Food Summit (see Annex 1)set a target of reducing the number of chronically hungry people to about 400 million, but current projections indicate that this figure may be achieved fifteen years later than targeted, i.e. by 2030, unless decisive policy and financial action is taken.<br/><br/>

Irrigated agriculture will by necessity claim large quantities of water to produce the food required to feed the world. Irrigation-water management has a long way to go to adapt to the new production requirements and reconcile competing claims from other economic sectors and calls for environmental protection. However, water-saving technologies are available and can significantly reduce the waste of water. In addition, the political, legal and institutional framework to support improved water productivity in irrigated agriculture also shows signs of adaptation. Water-management trends point to empowering stakeholders, with a priority for the poor and the marginalized. At the same time, the water needs for human health and for the aquatic environment call for closer attention. The message from agriculture, which will remain globally the largest water user, is cautiously optimistic.');
